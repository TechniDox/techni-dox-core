Phase One (MVP) Features – TechniDox

TechniDox Phase I (MVP) focuses on delivering core functionality that empowers technical writers and teams to host, publish, collaborate on, and measure the quality of their documentation. This first release is intentionally focused on the foundational features that differentiate TechniDox as a data-driven, AI-powered documentation platform.

1. Smart Document Hosting (Internal/External)

Description:
Users can upload or create documents within the platform, organize them by project, and choose whether to keep them private (internal) or make them public (external-facing docs).

Key Features:
	•	Markdown/MDX and HTML support
	•	Project-based folder structure
	•	Authentication and access control
	•	Optional GitHub integration for version control
	•	Preview mode for public-facing pages

Why it matters:
Streamlines technical writing workflows across both internal teams and open-source communities. Removes dependency on fragmented tools like Confluence, Notion, and GitHub Wikis.

2. Live Collaboration and Contribution Workflows

Description:
Built-in real-time editing and contribution tools that allow technical writers, engineers, and designers to collaborate seamlessly.

Key Features:
	•	Live collaborative editing (Google Docs-style or Git-based PR model)
	•	Inline suggestions and comments
	•	Contributor tagging and history tracking
	•	Role-based editing and approval workflows

Why it matters:
Encourages cross-functional documentation ownership, while creating a more inclusive and transparent review process for contributors.

3. AI-Powered Grammar, Style, and Inclusivity Scanner

Description:
Leverages AI (LLMs and NLP models) to scan documents for grammar, tone, inclusivity, and clarity. Returns actionable suggestions with justifications.

Key Features:
	•	Context-aware grammar and spelling checks
	•	Inclusive language detection
	•	Passive voice and readability scoring
	•	Terminology consistency analysis

Why it matters:
Raises the quality of documentation while reducing the time spent in manual editing cycles. Helps maintain brand, tone, and accessibility across large doc libraries.

4. Metric Tracker & Page Score

Description:
An analytics dashboard that scores documentation based on quality, completeness, and user engagement. Writers can track their content’s performance and impact.

Key Features:
	•	Page-level readability scores (Flesch, Hemingway, etc.)
	•	Engagement metrics (views, time on page, bounce rate)
	•	Contribution analytics (edits over time, contributor graph)
	•	Broken link detection and image audit

Why it matters:
Empowers writers and teams to iterate based on data. Demonstrates ROI of documentation by showing what’s working and what’s not.

5. Internal & External Publishing Pipelines

Description:
Documentation can be deployed securely for team access or shared with the public as clean, professional pages.

Key Features:
	•	One-click deploy to internal or public URLs
	•	Custom branding and theming
	•	Version control and changelog display
	•	Private preview links

Why it matters:
Supports modern DevRel and product teams who need to manage both private docs (e.g., engineering handbooks) and public docs (e.g., API references) from one unified system.

Optional Features for Future Phases (Not MVP but Worth Mentioning)
	•	Search indexing with AI summaries
	•	Chatbot doc assistant trained on your content
	•	Browser plugin for inline doc feedback
	•	Docs-as-code integrations with CI/CD workflows
